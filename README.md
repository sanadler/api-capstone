# Pokedex API Capstone

A pokemon index. This app allows you to choose a pokemon and see the abilities, moves, and the types this specific pokemon is. 
Users can then click on a type and see pokemon that are of the same type. Lastly, users can search for a pokemon at any point.

### Motivation

Wanted a place to go to see any pokemon and different statistics about each one.
